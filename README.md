## Key Attributes:
    1. OpenCV with dlib is used for face landmarks detection
    2. Using EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) for detection of sleepy, drowsy or active driver.
    3. Used streamlit to deploy the app on a webpage
    4. streamlit_webrtc for realtime webcam streaming

## Problem Statement: 
The project is concerned with identifying a solution that could be used to detect if the driver is drowsy or fatigued. Millions suffer annually (1.5M crashes, 800,000 injuries) from drowsiness-linked crashes, despite a 50% drop in reaction time within minutes.
Real-time detection can be the lifesaving difference.

## Methods
* Live video capture
* Video processing
* Face Landmark detection (68)
* EAR calculation
* Showing the driver status
* Deploy using streamlit
  
## 🛠 Tech Stack
* Python 3.10
* Numpy
* openCV (Computer Vision)
* Dlib (Face Landmark Detection)
* Streamlit-webrtc (Live Webcam feed)
* Streamlit (Deployment)

## Lessons learnt:
* How to use openCV?
* How to use Dlib?
* How to Deploy on Streamlit?
* How to use Streamlit-webrtc?

## What to do next?
* Detect other possible drowsiness and fatigue possibilities like: Head movements etc.
